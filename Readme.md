# metalsmith-templates

_Note: this plugin is deprecated, and was split into two simpler plugins:_

- _[metalsmith-layouts](https://github.com/ismay/metalsmith-layouts) for rendering templates inside nested layouts._
- _[metalsmith-in-place](https://github.com/ismay/metalsmith-in-place) for render an individual file through a templating engine._

_Check out those to repositories!_
